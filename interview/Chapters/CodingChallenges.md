# Coding Challenges

Like they say, practice makes perfect. Just like any other field, the more you practice , the better you get at coding. Most interviews have a live coding session where you may be asked to solve a technical challenge.  This section is dedicated to providing resources where you can practice coding challenges, simulating the kind of problems you might encounter in a live coding session during an interview. Aim to solve at least two challenges a day for consistent improvement.

## Data Structures and Algorithms Challenges

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - LeetCode offers a comprehensive collection of coding challenges that range in difficulty from easy to hard. These challenges focus primarily on data structures and algorithms, making it a popular destination for interview preparation.

- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
  - HackerRank provides a wide array of challenges across different domains, such as algorithms, data structures, artificial intelligence, and databases. It's a great platform for both learning and assessing your coding skills..

- [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com/)
  - Known for its timed challenges, CodeSignal offers an environment that mimics real interview scenarios. It provides a range of practice tests and interview preparation questions, which are excellent for honing your problem-solving skills under time constraints.

## System Design Challenges

- [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/)
  - Pramp is a peer-to-peer platform offering mock interviews, including system design. It allows you to practice with others, simulating real interview conditions, and receive valuable feedback.
