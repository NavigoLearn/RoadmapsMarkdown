## Chapter 6: Behavioral Aspects

As mentioned earlier in this roadmap, acing the interview involves more than just coding. Interviewers look at your ability to communicate, your attitude and other aspects relevant to your work as a programmer. This chapter covers some of the skills you require to ace the interview. 

### 6.1 Resume Building

Your resume is often the first impression you make on a potential employer. It needs to be clear, concise, and reflective of your skills and experiences. An effective resume not only lists your experiences but also highlights your achievements and the impact of your work.

## Additional Tips
Preparation for behavioral aspects is as crucial as technical preparation. Joining coding communities or groups can provide opportunities for peer reviews and extra practice. Engage in discussions, seek feedback, and learn from the experiences of others. Remember, the ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively are key skills that employers look for in a candidate.
