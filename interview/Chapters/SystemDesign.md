## Chapter 3: System Design

Systems are a major part of the work we do day to day. Interviewers tend to ask questions related to system design. On this chapter, we'll cover the key factors to consider when learning about system design. System Design questions are crucial for assessing a candidate's ability to design scalable and efficient systems. 

### 3.1 Basics of System Design

Understanding the basic principles of system design is essential for building robust and scalable systems. The basics of system design involve understanding how different components of a software system work together. This includes knowledge of databases, servers, networking, and client-server architecture. A fundamental grasp of these components allows you to design systems that are efficient and scalable.

Understanding system design requires a holistic view of software development, considering factors such as data flow, data storage, user interface, and user experience. It also involves decisions about choosing the right technology stack and designing a system that can handle changes and growth over time. This part of the chapter will set a solid foundation for more advanced concepts in system design.

### 3.2 Scalability

Scalability is a key consideration in system design, focusing on a system's ability to handle growth and increased demand. A scalable system can accommodate a growing number of users, increased data volume, and more complex operations without sacrificing performance.

The chapter on scalability will cover various strategies to ensure that systems can scale horizontally (adding more machines) or vertically (adding more power to existing machines). Topics like distributed systems, database sharding, and microservices architecture are essential in understanding how to build systems that can grow with the user base and data.

### 3.3 Load Balancing

Load balancing is about distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server bears too much demand. By balancing the workload, load balancing helps in achieving optimal resource utilization, maximizing throughput, minimizing response time, and avoiding overload of any single resource.

In this section, you'll learn about different load balancing techniques and their implementation in various scenarios. This knowledge is crucial for designing systems that remain stable and efficient under varying load conditions.

### 3.4 Caching Strategies

Caching is a strategy to temporarily store copies of data in a high-speed data storage layer, improving the speed of data retrieval in future requests. Effective caching reduces the need to access the underlying slower storage layer, significantly speeding up data access for frequently requested data.

This section will explore different caching strategies, their applications, and best practices. Understanding caching is vital for system performance optimization and is an integral part of system design.

### 3.5 Database Design

Database design is a crucial aspect of system design, involving the creation of a detailed data model for a database. It defines how data is stored, accessed, and managed in a database system. Good database design ensures data integrity, efficiency in data retrieval, and scalability.

This section will guide you through the fundamentals of database design, including normalization, schema design, and understanding relationships between different data entities. This knowledge is essential for creating robust and efficient database systems.
