## Chapter 10: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are key practices in modern software development, especially in the context of DevOps. They streamline the process of integrating code changes and deploying them to production. This chapter will cover the fundamental concepts, tools, and best practices for implementing CI/CD in software projects.

### 10.1 Introduction to CI/CD
CI/CD introduces automation into the stages of software development, specifically integration, testing, and deployment. Continuous Integration (CI) focuses on integrating code changes into a shared repository frequently, whereas Continuous Deployment (CD) is about automated deployment of the code to production environments. This section provides an overview of CI/CD, its significance in software development, and how it contributes to delivering high-quality software at a faster pace.

### 10.2 Setting Up Continuous Integration
Setting up a CI environment involves selecting a CI tool, configuring the build process, and integrating with a version control system. This section discusses the steps to set up a CI pipeline and how to automate the build and testing phases for every code commit or merge request.

### 10.3 Implementing Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment takes CI a step further by automatically deploying the code to production after passing the build and test phases. This section covers strategies for implementing CD, including blue-green deployments, canary releases, and feature toggles. It also discusses monitoring and rollback mechanisms for ensuring stable deployments.
