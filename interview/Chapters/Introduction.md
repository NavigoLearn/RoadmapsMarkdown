# Ace The Code Interview Preparation

Welcome to the Code Interview Preparation Roadmap! Getting a job as a programmer is challenging on all levels. From the junior developer, to the tech lead. This comprehensive guide is designed to help developers gain the appropriate skills, knowledge and belief to ace the coding interview. 

## What to expect

Coding is not the only part of acing the programming interview. This roadmap covers not only the key fundamental coding questions frequently asked in interviews, but also, the soft-skills and problem solving skills required to ace the interview.

### What We'll cover: 
1. **Data Structures**: Dive deep into arrays, linked lists, trees, and more. Understand their workings, applications, and nuances.
2. **Algorithms**: Learn about sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and other algorithmic strategies crucial for problem-solving.
3. **System Design**: Grasp the fundamentals of designing scalable and efficient systems, a must-know for senior-level interviews.
4. **Programming Languages**: Brush up on the syntax, features, and best practices of popular programming languages like Python, Java, and JavaScript.
5. **Coding Problem Solving**: Tackle common and complex coding problems, learning how to approach and solve them efficiently.
6. **Behavioral Aspects**: Prepare for the non-technical side of interviews, focusing on communication skills, resume building, and behavioral questions.
7. **Mock Interviews**: Engage in simulated interview scenarios to practice and refine your skills in a real-world setting.
8. **Version Control Systems**: Understand the essentials of version control, focusing on Git for managing and collaborating on code.
9. **Software Testing**: Explore various testing methodologies, unit testing, integration testing, and test-driven development.
10. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Delve into CI/CD principles and practices for automated, efficient software delivery.
11. **Cloud Computing and Services**: Learn the basics of cloud computing, major cloud service providers, and how to leverage cloud services in development.
