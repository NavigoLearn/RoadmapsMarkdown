## Chapter 11: Cloud Computing and Services

Cloud computing has revolutionized the way we build, deploy, and manage applications, offering scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions. This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, major cloud service providers, and how to leverage cloud services in software development.

### 11.1 Basics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. This section introduces the basics of cloud computing, its service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and deployment models (public, private, hybrid).
