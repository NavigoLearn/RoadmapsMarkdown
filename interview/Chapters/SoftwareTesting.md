## Chapter 9: Software Testing
Software testing is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle, ensuring the quality, reliability, and performance of the application. This chapter aims to provide a thorough understanding of various testing methodologies and their practical applications in software engineering.

### 9.1 Introduction to Software Testing
Software testing involves the execution of a program or application with the intent of finding bugs and ensuring that the software functions as expected. This section will introduce the fundamental concepts of software testing, its importance in the development process, and the various types of testing methodologies like unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
