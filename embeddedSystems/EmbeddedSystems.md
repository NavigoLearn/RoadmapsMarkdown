# Embedded Systems

## Description

This road map gives a general overview of the concepts you will need to know to become an Embedded Systems Engineer. Becoming an embedded engineer requires a broad understanding of both software and hardware for. The topics have been carefully selected to reflect standard requirements of an Embedded Systems Engineer. A lot of passion and determination will be required of you to succeed in this field.

## What is an Embedded System?

An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software, and perhaps additional mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated function. In some cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or product, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.

## Essential Prerequisites

- Basic Math and Calculus
  - Ideally you should have a strong foundation in mathematics, particularly in areas such as algebra, calculus, and discrete mathematics. Knowledge of algebra is important for understanding and manipulating mathematical expressions, while calculus is essential for dealing with continuous signals and control systems.
