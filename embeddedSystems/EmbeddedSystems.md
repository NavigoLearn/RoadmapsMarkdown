# Embedded Systems

## Description

This road map gives a general overview of the concepts you will need to know to become an Embedded Systems Engineer. Becoming an embedded engineer requires a broad understanding of both software and hardware for. The topics have been carefully selected to reflect standard requirements of an Embedded Systems Engineer. A lot of passion and determination will be required of you to succeed in this field.

## What is an Embedded System?

An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software, and perhaps additional mechanical or other parts, designed to perform a dedicated function. In some cases, embedded systems are part of a larger system or product, as in the case of an antilock braking system in a car.
